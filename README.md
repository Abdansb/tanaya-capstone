# Tanaya Capstone Project
# Overview

Tanaya is a mobile application designed to assist small farmers in detecting soil types through image analysis and providing crop recommendations based on the identified soil type. The project is developed as part of the capstone project for the Bangkit program 2023 Batch 1.

# Project Description

Tanaya aims to support small farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection by leveraging image analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. By capturing images of soil samples using the app, Tanaya analyzes the images to determine the soil type accurately. Using this information, the app provides personalized crop recommendations that are suitable for the specific soil type identified. The goal is to empower small farmers with valuable insights to improve crop productivity and optimize resource utilization.
